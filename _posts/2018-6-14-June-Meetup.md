Greetings friends! Our 3rd official meetup will be happening Wednesday, June 27th, 2018 at 6:00pm @ [Conservatory](http://conservatoryhtx.com "conservatoryhtx").

No agenda this time, so bring a project you'd like to talk about and we'll discuss! You can also find us on [JAMF Nation](https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/events/user-groups/219/houston-apple-admins-meet-up). 

Hope to see you there!
