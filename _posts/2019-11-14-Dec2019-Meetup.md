October was so hectic we forgot to firm up plans for our November meetup! But better late than never, right?

We'll be having a casual happy hour + dinner meet up at the newly opened Buffalo Bayou Brewing Company this time.

We hope you can join us!

Please RSVP on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Houston-Apple-Admins/events/266471617/) or at [Jamf Nation](https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/events/user-groups/312/houston-apple-admins-december-2019-meetup) so we can get an idea of who is coming.
