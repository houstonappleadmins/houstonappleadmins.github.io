Summer break is over and we’re back to business. We’ll be meeting at FlightAware in September and hope you can join us.

MunkiReport will be our main topic of discussion this time: Freshly back from MacDevOpsYVR we’ll hear what Jonathan learned and what he thinks about the conference in general. Kevin will share details on creating dashboards to consolidate information on specific topics for easy reference.

As always we’ll have open discussion and can cover any topic desired. If you’d like to present just let us know, we’d love to hear what you are working on lately.

Please RSVP on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Houston-Apple-Admins/events/263370191/) or at [Jamf Nation](https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/events/user-groups/295/houston-apple-admins-september-2019-meetup) so we can get an idea of who is coming. We’re anticipating that pizza and soda will be graciously provided again by Jamf.
