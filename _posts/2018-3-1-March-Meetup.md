Greetings friends! Our 2nd official meetup will be happening on March 21, 2018 at 5:30pm-ish @ [Conservatory](http://conservatoryhtx.com "conservatoryhtx").

MacAdmin [@kylebradbury](https://twitter.com/kylebradbury) will do a short presentation on [Apache Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org), but mostly we will be doing introductions, drinking beer and brainstorming ways get more of the Houston MacAdmin community involved.

Hope to see you there!
