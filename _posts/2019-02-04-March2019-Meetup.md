Thanks to [Envision Design](https://www.envisiondesign.net) and Chris Peters for hosting this time. We're once again anticipating Jamf providing pizza and sodas.

There is no formal agenda yet and we're always open to discussing any topic of interest. If you'd like to present the latest project you have been working on just ask.

You can also find us on [JAMF Nation](https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/events/user-groups/259/houston-apple-admins-march-2019-meet-up) and [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Houston-Apple-Admins/events/258680520/). Please RSVP at either (or both) links.

We hope to see you there!
